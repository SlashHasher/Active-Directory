<h1> üñ•Ô∏è Enterprise Active Directory Deployment with SIEM and Automation (Vultr, Splunk, Slack, Shuffle) </h1>



<h2> üìÑ Description</h2>
This project simulates a real-world enterprise Active Directory environment built on cloud infrastructure. It includes the design, deployment, and security hardening of a Windows-based AD domain, along with integration of Splunk for log analysis and Slack + Shuffle for automated incident response. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with identity management, monitoring, and security automation.

<h2> ‚úÖ Conclusion</h2>
This project served as a comprehensive, real-world simulation of deploying and securing an enterprise-grade Active Directory environment in the cloud. From initial architecture planning to implementing automated security workflows, each phase contributed to a deeper understanding of Windows-based identity management, log monitoring, and incident response.

By building the domain from scratch, integrating Splunk for centralized logging, and automating alert handling with Shuffle and Slack, I explored how large-scale organizations manage and secure their infrastructure. The process involved several technical challenges, including domain controller configuration issues, log forwarding misconfigurations, and automation setup problems. Solving these problems helped reinforce key skills in system administration, debugging, and integrating security tools.

I plan to continue building on this lab by adding threat simulations, detection rules, and additional incident response playbooks. These additions will bring the environment even closer to the workflows used in real-world security operations centers.
